abstract = {Background and purpose — The continuously increasing demand for joint replacement surgery in the past decades imposes higher constraints on the budgets of hospitals and healthcare providers. We undertook an analysis of historical trends in total hip replace-ment performed in Sweden between 1968 and 2012 in order to provide projections of future demand. Data and methods — We obtained data on total hip replace-ments registered every year and on the evolution of the Swedish population between 1968 and 2012. We assumed the existence of a maximum incidence. So we adopted a regression framework that assumes the existence of an upper limit of total hip replacement incidence. Results — We found that the incidence of total hip replacement will continue to increase until a projected upper incidence level of about 400 total hip replacements per 10 5 Swedish residents aged 40 years and older will be reached around the year 2107. In 2020, the estimated incidence of total hip replacement will be 341 (95{\%} prediction interval (PI): 302–375) and in 2030 it will be 358 (PI: 317–396). Using official forecasted population growth data, about 18,000 operations would be expected to be performed in 2020 and 20,000 would be expected to be performed in 2030. Interpretation — Growing incidence, population growth, and increasing life expectancy will probably result in increased demand for hip replacement surgery. Our findings could serve as a basis for decision making. },

@article{Cattin1980,
abstract = {There are two ways to estimate the predictive power of a regression model: a cross-validation procedure and a formula. A number of formulas have been derived. A review of the literature leads to four (unbiased or least biased) formulas, each one appropriate depending on whether the predictor variables are fixed or random and on the measure needed, that is, a measure of the absolute error (the mean squared error of prediction) or of the relative error (the cross-validated multiple correlation). The advantages of these formulas over cross-validation are that they are less cumbersome to use and that they produce more precise estimates. The conditions under which it is appropriate to use these formulas are discussed as well as their use for comparing the predictive power of regression, subjective and equal weights.

abstract = {The performance of a predictive model is overestimated when simply determined on the sample of subjects that was used to construct the model. Several internal validation methods are available that aim to provide a more accurate estimate of model performance in new subjects. We evaluated several variants of split-sample, cross-validation and bootstrapping methods with a logistic regression model that included eight predictors for 30-day mortality after an acute myocardial infarction. Random samples with a size between n = 572 and n = 9165 were drawn from a large data set (GUSTO-I; n = 40,830; 2851 deaths) to reflect modeling in data sets with between 5 and 80 events per variable. Independent performance was determined on the remaining subjects. Performance measures included discriminative ability, calibration and overall accuracy. We found that split-sample analyses gave overly pessimistic estimates of performance, with large variability. Cross-validation on 10{\%} of the sample had low bias and low variability, but was not suitable for all performance measures. Internal validity could best be estimated with bootstrapping, which provided stable estimates with low bias. We conclude that split-sample validation is inefficient, and recommend bootstrapping for estimation of internal validity of a predictive logistic regression model.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commit-ment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current prob-lems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.},

abstract = {Background Despite the overall effectiveness of total hip arthroplasty (THA), a subset of patients remain dissatisfied with their results because of persistent pain or functional limitations. It is therefore important to develop predictive tools capable of identifying patients at risk for poor out-comes before surgery. Questions/purposes The purpose of this study was to use preoperative patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) scores to predict which patients undergoing THA are most likely to experience a clinically meaningful change in functional outcome 1 year after surgery. Methods A retrospective cohort study design was used to evaluate preoperative and 1-year postoperative SF-12 ver-sion 2 (SF12v2) and Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) scores from 537 selected patients who underwent primary unilateral THA. Minimum clini-cally important differences (MCIDs) were calculated using a distribution-based method. A receiver operating charac-teristic analysis was used to calculate threshold values, defined as the levels at which substantial changes occurred, and their predictive ability. MCID values for HOOS and SF12v2 physical component summary (PCS) scores were calculated to be 9.1 and 4.6, respectively. We analyzed the effect of SF12v2 mental component summary (MCS) scores, which measure mental and emotional health, on SF12v2 PCS and HOOS threshold values. Results Threshold values for preoperative HOOS and PCS scores were a maximum of 51.0 (area under the curve [AUC], 0.74; p $\backslash$ 0.001) and 32.5 (AUC, 0.62; p $\backslash$ 0.001), respectively. As preoperative mental and emotional health improved, which was reflected by a higher MCS score, HOOS and PCS threshold values also increased.

Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.},

Here, we describe the purpose, organization, variables, coverage and completeness of 103 Swedish QRs. METHODS: From March to September 2013, we examined the 2012 applications of 103 QRs to the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) and also studied the annual reports from the same QRs. After initial data abstraction, the coordinator of each QR was contacted at least twice between June and October 2013 and asked to confirm the accuracy of the data retrieved from the applications and reports. RESULTS: About 60{\%} of the QRs covered ≥80{\%} of their target population (completeness). Data recorded in Swedish QRs include aspects of disease management (diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment and lead times). In addition, some QRs retrieve data on self-reported quality of life (EQ5D, SF-36 and disease-specific measures), lifestyle (smoking) and general health status (World Health Organization performance status, body mass index and blood pressure). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical data available in Swedish QRs complement information from government-administered registries and provide an important source not only for assessment and development of quality of care but also for research.},

abstract = {In regression analysis, the notion of population validity is of theoretical interest for describing the usefulness of the underlying regression model, whereas the presumably more important concept of population cross-validity represents the predictive effectiveness for the regression equation in future research. It appears that the inference procedures of the squared multiple correlation coefficient have been extensively developed. In contrast, a full range of statistical methods for the analysis of the squared cross-validity coefficient is considerably far from complete. This article considers a distinct expression for the definition of the squared cross-validity coefficient as the direct connection and monotone transformation to the squared multiple correlation coefficient. Therefore, all the currently available exact methods for interval estimation, power calculation, and sample size determination of the squared multiple correlation coefficient are naturally modified and extended to the analysis of the squared cross-validity coefficient. The adequacies of the existing approximate procedures and the suggested exact method are evaluated through a Monte Carlo study. Furthermore, practical applications in areas of psychology and management are presented to illustrate the essential features of the proposed methodologies. The first empirical example uses 6 control variables related to driver characteristics and traffic congestion and their relation to stress in bus drivers, and the second example relates skills, cognitive performance, and personality to team performance measures. The results in this article can facilitate the recommended practice of cross-validation in psychological and other areas of social science research. (Contains 2 figures and 8 tables.)},

abstract = {Background Considering the cost and risk associated with revision Total knee arthroplasty (TKAs) and Total hip arthroplasty (THAs), steps to prevent these operations will help patients and reduce healthcare costs. Revision risk calculators for patients may reduce revision surgery by supporting clinical decision-making at the point of care. Questions/purposes We sought to develop a TKA and THA revision risk calculator using data from a large health-maintenance organization's arthroplasty registry and determine the best set of predictors for the revision risk calculator. Methods Revision risk calculators for THAs and TKAs were developed using a patient cohort from a total joint replacement registry and data from a large US integrated healthcare system. The cohort included all patients who had primary procedures performed in our healthcare system between April 2001 and July 2008 and were followed until January 2014 (TKAs, n = 41,750; THAs, n = 22,721), During the study period, 9{\%} of patients (TKA = 3066/34,686; THA=1898/20,285) were lost to followup and 7{\%} died (TKA= 2350/41,750; THA=1419/20,285). The outcome of interest was revision surgery and was defined as replacement of any component for any reason within 5 years postoperatively. Candidate predictors for the revision risk calculator were limited to preoperative patient demographics, comorbidities, and procedure diagnoses. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and c-statistic were used to choose final models for the revision risk calculator. Results The best predictors for the TKA revision risk calculator were age (odds ratio [OR], 0.96; 95{\%} CI, 0.95-0.97; p < 0.001), sex (OR, 0.84; 95{\%} CI, 0.75-0.95; p = 0.004), square-root BMI (OR, 1.05; 95{\%} CI, 0.99-1.11; p = 0.140), diabetes (OR, 1.32; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-1.48; p < 0.001), osteoarthritis (OR, 1.16; 95{\%} CI, 0.84-1.62; p = 0.368), posttraumatic arthritis (OR, 1.66; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-2.56; p = 0.022), and osteonecrosis (OR, 2.54; 95{\%} CI, 1.31-4.92; p = 0.006). The best predictors for the THA revision risk calculator were sex (OR, 1.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.46; p = 0.010), age (OR, 0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.98-0.99; p < 0.001), square-root BMI (OR, 1.07; 95{\%} CI, 1.00-1.15; p = 0.066), and osteoarthritis (OR, 0.85; 95{\%} CI, 0.66-1.09; p = 0.190). Conclusions Study model parameters can be used to create web-based calculators. Surgeons can enter personalized patient data in the risk calculators for identification of risk of revision which can be used for clinical decision making at the point of care. Future prospective studies will be needed to validate these calculators and to refine them with time.},

Using an eight-predictor model, 500 estimates for each of 9 validity and 11 cross-validity estimation procedures were generated for each sample size condition. These estimates were then compared to the actual squared population validity and cross-validity in terms of mean bias and mean squared bias. For the regression models determined using ordinary least squares, the Ezekiel procedure produced the most accurate estimates of squared population validity (followed by the Smith and the Wherry procedures), and Burket’s formula resulted in the best estimates of squared population cross-validity. Other analyses compared the coefficients determined by traditional empirical cross-validation and equal weights; equal weights resulted in no loss of predictive accuracy and less shrinkage. Numerous issues for future basic research on validation and cross-validation are identified.},

However, utilisation rates vary hugely, there are no indications, it is difficult to know when (in the course of arthritis) it is best to operate, and some 10-20{\%} of people who have this surgery are unhappy with the outcome, and have persistent pain. In this article we briefly discuss the variations in utilization of knee joint replacement, and then outline four different approaches to the selection and prioritisation of patients for this procedure. Consensus criteria, including appropriateness criteria are available, but if produced by professionals alone, they may conflict with the views of patients and the public. Databases and cohort studies can be used to attempt relating outcomes to baseline characteristics, but at present we can only account for a small percentage of the variance with this technique. Finally, we propose use of the 'capacity to benefit framework' to attempt providing guidance to both patients and healthcare professionals.},

Such evaluation cannot be achieved with studies of real data alone. Designing high-quality simulations that reflect the complex situations seen in practice, such as in prognostic factors studies, is not a simple process. Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported.

A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided.

Current error estimation methods are not satisfactory because they either have large variability (such as leave-one-out cross-validation) or large bias (such as resubstitution and leave-one-out bootstrap). While small sample size remains one of the key features of costly clinical investigations or of microarray studies that have limited resources in funding, time and tissue materials, accurate and easy-to-implement error estimation methods for small samples are desirable and will be beneficial.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A bootstrap cross-validation method is studied. It achieves accurate error estimation through a simple procedure with bootstrap resampling and only costs computer CPU time. Simulation studies and applications to microarray data demonstrate that it performs consistently better than its competitors. This method possesses several attractive properties: (1) it is implemented through a simple procedure; (2) it performs well for small samples with sample size, as small as 16; (3) it is not restricted to any particular classification rules and thus applies to many parametric or non-parametric methods.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Traditions are passed on from experienced surgeons to younger fellows and become "the right way to do it". Traditions associated with arthroplasty surgery may, however, not be evidence-based and may be potentially deleterious to both patients and society, increasing morbidity and mortality, slowing early functional recovery, and increasing cost.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We identified selected traditions and performed a literature search using relevant search criteria (June 2014). We present a narrative review grading the studies according to evidence, and we suggest some lines of future research.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present traditions and evaluate them against the published evidence. Preoperative removal of hair, urine testing for bacteria, use of plastic adhesive drapes intraoperatively, and prewarming of the operation room should be abandoned-as should use of a tourniquet, a space suit, a urinary catheter, and closure of the knee in extension. The safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid is supported by meta-analyses. Postoperatively, there is no evidence to support postponement of showering or postponement of changing of dressings to after 48 h. There is no evidence to recommend routine dental antibiotic prophylaxis, continuous passive motion (CPM), the use of compression stockings, cooling for pain control or reduction of swelling, flexion of at least 90 degrees as a discharge criterion following TKA, or having restrictions after THA. We present evidence supporting the use of NSAIDs, early mobilization, allowing early travel, and a low hemoglobin trigger for transfusion.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nINTERPRETATION: Revision of traditions and myths surrounding hip and knee arthroplasty towards more contemporary evidence-based principles can be expected to improve early functional recovery, thus reducing morbidity, mortality, and costs.},

The programme started in 2002 and has gradually expanded to include all units performing total hip replacement in Sweden. The self-administered PROMs protocol comprises the EQ-5D instrument, the Charnley class categorisation and visual analogue scales for pain and satisfaction. These current analyses include 34 960 total hip replacements with complete pre-and one-year post-operative questionnaires. Patients eligible for total hip replacement generally report low health-related quality of life and suffer from pain. One year post-operatively the mean EQ-5D index increased to above the level of an age-and gender-matched population, with a considerable reduction of pain (p < 0.001). Females, younger patients and those with Charnley category C reported a lower EQ-5D index pre-operatively than males, older patients and Charnley category A or B, respectively (all p < 0.001). In a multivariable regression analysis Charnley category C, male gender and higher age were associated with less improvement in health-related quality of life (p < 0.001). Nationwide implementation of a PROMs programme requires a structured organisation and effective data capture. Patients' response rates to the Registry are good. The continuous collection of PROMs permits local and national improvement work and allows for further health-economic evaluation.},

abstract = {Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) are recognised and proven interventions for patients with advanced arthritis. Studies to date have demonstrated a steady increase in the requirement for primary and revision procedures. Projected estimates made for the United States show that by 2030 the demand for primary TKA will grow by 673{\%} and for revision TKA by 601{\%} from the level in 2005. For THA the projected estimates are 174{\%} and 137{\%} for primary and revision surgery, respectively. The purpose of this study was to see if those predictions were similar for England and Wales using data from the National Joint Registry and the Office of National Statistics. Analysis of data for England and Wales suggest that by 2030, the volume of primary and revision TKAs will have increased by 117{\%} and 332{\%}, respectively between 2012 and 2030. The data for the United States translates to a 306{\%} cumulative rate of increase between 2012 and 2030 for revision surgery, which is similar to our predictions for England and Wales. The predictions from the United States for primary TKA were similar to our upper limit projections. For THA, we predicted an increase of 134{\%} and 31{\%} for primary and revision hip surgery, respectively. Our model has limitations, however, it highlights the economic burden of arthroplasty in the future in England and Wales as a real and unaddressed problem. This will have significant implications for the provision of health care and the management of orthopaedic services in the future.},

abstract = {This article proposes an extension of the propensity score adjustment method to latent variable models. The propensity score was proposed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) as a means of balancing treatment and control groups with respect to observed covariates in non-randomized studies. The propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of assignment to a treatment group given a set of observed covariates. In a typical application of this approach, each observation is associated with a propensity to be assigned to the treatment group. The distribution of propensity scores is then divided into strata and analyses of treatment group differences are conducted within strata. Comparisons of treatment group differences within and across strata provide evidence for whether or not the bias due to non-random selection into treatment groups has been accounted for by the propensity score adjustment. This article extends the application of the propensity score approach to the analysis o f group differences on latent variables. In particular, multi-sample MIMIC modeling is utilized to test hypotheses about treatment group differences on latent variables across strata. The role of factorial invariance as it relates to the approach advocated in this article is also discussed.

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

abstract = {Background: To facilitate the discussion on the increasing number of total hip replacements (THR) and their effectiveness, we apply a joint evaluation of hospital case costs and health outcomes at the patient level to enable comparative effectiveness research (CER) based on the preoperative health state. Methods: In 2012, 292 patients from a German orthopedic hospital participated in health state evaluation before and 6 months after THR, where health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease specific pain and dysfunction were analyzed using EQ-5D and WOMAC scores. Costs were measured with a patient-based DRG costing scheme in a prospective observation of a cohort. Costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated based on the preoperative WOMAC score, as preoperative health states were found to be the best predictors of QALY gains in multivariate linear regressions. Results: Mean inpatient costs of THR were 6,310 Euros for primary replacement and 7,730 Euros for inpatient lifetime costs including revisions. QALYs gained using the U.K. population preference-weighted index were 5.95. Lifetime costs per QALY were 1,300 Euros. Conclusions: The WOMAC score and the EQ-5D score before operation were the most important predictors of QALY gains. The poorer the WOMAC score or the EQ-5D score before operation, the higher the patient benefit. Costs per QALY were far below common thresholds in all preoperative utility score groups and with all underlying calculation methodologies.},

abstract = {A valid comparison of the magnitude of two correlations requires researchers to directly contrast the correlations using an appropriate statistical test. In many popular statistics packages, however, tests for the significance of the difference between correlations are missing. To close this gap, we introduce cocor, a free software package for the R programming language. The cocor package covers a broad range of tests including the comparisons of independent and dependent correlations with either overlapping or nonoverlapping variables. The package also includes an implementation of Zou's confidence interval for all of these comparisons. The platform independent cocor package enhances the R statistical computing environment and is available for scripting. Two different graphical user interfaces-a plugin for RKWard and a web interface-make cocor a convenient and user-friendly tool.},

abstract = {Shared decision-making is increasingly advocated as an ideal model of treatment decision-making in the medical encounter. To date, the concept has been rather poorly and loosely defined. This paper attempts to provide greater conceptual clarity about shared treatment decision-making, identify some key characteristics of this model, and discuss measurement issues. The particular decision-making context that we focus on is potentially life threatening illnesses, where there are important decisions to be made at key points in the disease process, and several treatment options exist with different possible outcomes and substantial uncertainty. We suggest as key characteristics of shared decision-making (1) that at least two participants-physician and patient be involved; (2) that both parties share information; (3) that both parties take steps to build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and (4) that an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement. Some challenges to measuring shared decision-making are discussed as well as potential benefits of a shared decision-making model for both physicians and patients.},

Previous research suggests that z transformation may effectively correct mean bias for N's less than 30. In this study, simulations with small (20 and 30) and large (50 and 100) N's found that mean bias adjustments for larger N's are seldom needed. However, z transformations improved confidence intervals even for N = 100. The improvement was not in the estimated standard errors so much as in the asymmetrical CI's estimates based upon the z transformation. The resulting observed probabilities were generally accurate to within 1 point in the first non-zero digit. These issues are an order of magnitude less important for accuracy than design issues influencing the accuracy of the results, such as reliability, restriction of range, and N.

abstract = {Background: The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of preoperative patient characteristics on health outcomes 6 months after total hip replacement (THR), to support patient's decision making in daily practice with predicted health states and satisfaction thresholds. By giving incremental effects for different patient subgroups, we support comparative effectiveness research (CER) on osteoarthritis interventions. Methods: In 2012, 321 patients participated in health state evaluation before and 6 months after THR. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured with the EQ-5D questionnaire. Hip-specific pain, function, and mobility were measured with the WOMAC in a prospective observation of a cohort. The predictive capability of preoperative patient characteristics – classified according to socio-demographic factors, medical factors, and health state variables – for changes in health outcomes is tested by correlation analysis and multivariate linear regressions. Related satisfaction thresholds were calculated with the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) concept. Results: The mean WOMAC and EQ-5D scores before operation were 52 and 60 respectively (0 worst, 100 best). At the 6-month follow-up, scores improved by 35 and 19 units. On average, patients reported satisfaction with the operation if postoperative (change) WOMAC scores were higher than 85 (32) and postoperative (change) EQ-5D scores were higher than 79 (14). Conclusions: Changes in WOMAC and EQ-5D scores can mainly be explained by preoperative scores. The lower the preoperative WOMAC or EQ-5D scores, the higher the change in the scores. Very good or very poor preoperative scores lower the probability of patient satisfaction with THR. Shared decision making using a personalized risk assessment approach provides predicted health states and satisfaction thresholds.},

abstract = {Content: Shared medical decision making is a process by which patients and providers consider outcome probabilities and patient preferences and reach a health care decision based on mutual agreement. Shared decision making is best used for problems involving medical uncertainty. During the process the provider-patient dyad considers treatment options and consequences and explores the fit of expected benefits and consequences of treatment with patient preferences for various outcomes. This paper reviews the literature on shared medical decision making. Several questions are considered. Although several studies suggest that patients do not want to be involved in decision making, these studies typically fail to separate decisions about technical aspects of treatment from preferences for outcomes. There is considerable evidence that patients want to be consulted about the impact of treatment. Studies on the acceptability of shared decision making for physicians have produced inconsistent results. Shared decision making is more acceptable to younger and better-educated patients. It remains unclear whether shared decision making requires expensive video presentations or whether the same results can be obtained with simpler methods, such as the decision board. We conclude that shared medical decision making is an important development in health care. More research is necessary to identify the effects of shared decision making on patient satisfaction and health outcomes. Further, more research is necessary in order to evaluate the most effective methods for engaging patients in decisions about their own health care. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): decision making, outcome assessment, research, patient satisfaction, probability, decision aid (Am J Prev Med 1999;17(4):285–294) © 1999 American Journal of Preventive Medicine O ver the last decades, there has been an increas-ing emphasis on patient participation in med-ical decision making. An alternative to the paternalistic model in which the physician makes all treatment decisions is " shared decision making. " Shared decision making must not be confused with obtaining informed consent from a patient. While ethical guidelines mandate informed consent, espe-cially when a recommendation involves a potentially harmful intervention, shared decision making goes several steps further. Beyond presenting the patient with facts about a procedure, shared decision making is a process by which doctor and patient consider avail-able information about the medical problem in ques-tion, including treatment options and consequences, and then consider how these fit with the patient's preferences for health states and outcomes. After con-sidering the options, a treatment decision is made based on mutual agreement. 1 Several conditions must be met for shared decision making to occur. First, the atmosphere must be conducive to active patient partic-ipation. The attending physician must make patients feel that their contributions are valued. Patients in turn need to be frank about their preferences and goals for treatment. The physician then helps the patient deter-mine how these goals and preferences fit with the available treatment options and a shared decision is reached.},

abstract = {For mixed regression models, we define a variance decomposition including three terms, explained individual variance, unexplained individual variance and noise variance. In contrast to traditional variance decomposition, it is thus the unexplained, not the explained, variance that is split. It gives rise to a coefficient of individual determination (CID) defined as the estimated fraction of explained individual variance. We argue that in many applications CID is a valuable complement to R2, since it excludes noise variance (which can never be explained) and thus has one as a natural upper bound. A general theory for coefficients determination is presented, including various choices of regression models, weight functions and parameter estimates. In particular we focus on models where CID is computable, such as univariate mixed Poisson and logistic regression models, as well as multivariate mixed linear regression models. Large sample properties and confidence intervals are derived and finally, the theory is exemplified using Poisson regression on a Swedish motor traffic insurance data set. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The interest in statistical classification for critical applications such as diagnoses of patient samples based on supervised learning is rapidly growing. To gain acceptance in applications where the subsequent decisions have serious consequences, e.g. choice of cancer therapy, any such decision support system must come with a reliable performance estimate. Tailored for small sample problems, cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (BTS) have been the most commonly used methods to determine such estimates in virtually all branches of science for the last 20 years. Here, we address the often overlooked fact that the uncertainty in a point estimate obtained with CV and BTS is unknown and quite large for small sample classification problems encountered in biomedical applications and elsewhere. To avoid this fundamental problem of employing CV and BTS, until improved alternatives have been established, we suggest that the final classification performance always should be reported in the form of a Bayesian confidence interval obtained from a simple holdout test or using some other method that yields conservative measures of the uncertainty. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Background and purpose — The incidence of knee osteoarthritis will most likely increase. We analyzed historical trends in the inci-dence of knee arthroplasty in Sweden between 1975 and 2013, in order to be able to provide projections of future demand. Patients and methods — We obtained information on all knee arthroplasties in Sweden in the period 1975–2013 from the Swed-ish Knee Arthroplasty Register, and used public domain data from Statistics Sweden on the evolution of and forecasts for the Swedish population. We forecast the incidence, presuming the existence of a maximum incidence. Results — We found that the incidence of knee arthroplasty will continue to increase until a projected upper incidence level of about 469 total knee replacements per 10 5 Swedish residents aged 40 years and older is reached around the year 2130. In 2020, the estimated incidence of total knee arthroplasties per 10 5 Swed-ish residents aged 40 years and older will be 334 (95{\%} prediction interval (PI): 281–374) and in 2030 it will be 382 (PI: 308–441). Using officially forecast population growth data, around 17,500 operations would be expected to be performed in 2020 and around 21,700 would be expected to be performed in 2030. Interpretation — Today's levels of knee arthroplasty are well below the expected maximum incidence, and we expect a contin-ued annual increase in the total number of knee arthroplasties performed. },

Two categories of formulas were identified: estimators of the squared population multiple correlation coefficient ($\rho$2) and those of the squared population cross-validity coefficient ($\rho$c 2). The authors conducted a Monte Carlo experiment to investigate the effectiveness of the analytical formulas for estimating R 2 shrinkage, with 4 fully crossed factors (squared population multiple correlation coefficient, number of predictors, sample size, and degree of multicollinearity) and 500 replications in each cell. The results indicated that the most widely used Wherry formula (in both SAS and SPSS) is probably not the most effective analytical formula for estimating $\rho$2. Instead, the Pratt formula and the Browne formula outperformed other analytical formulas in estimating $\rho$2 and $\rho$c 2, respectively.},

abstract = {Background: Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. Results: We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" and "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error. The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30{\%} on 18.5{\%} of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30{\%} on 38{\%} of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions. Conclusion: We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error.},

abstract = {We consider the accuracy estimation of a classifier constructed on a given training sample. The naive resubstitution estimate is known to have a downward bias problem. The traditional approach to tackling this bias problem is cross-validation. The bootstrap is another way to bring down the high variability of cross-validation. But a direct comparison of the two estimators, cross-validation and bootstrap, is not fair because the latter estimator requires much heavier computation. We performed an empirical study to compare the??.632+??bootstrap estimator with the repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the repeated one-third holdout estimator. All the estimators were set to require about the same amount of computation. In the simulation study, the repeated 10-fold cross-validation estimator was found to have better performance than the??.632+??bootstrap estimator when the classifier is highly adaptive to the training sample. We have also found that the??.632+??bootstrap estimator suffers from a bias problem for large samples as well as for small samples. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Swedish health care and national health registers are dependent on the presence of a unique identifier. This paper describes the Swedish personal identity number (PIN) and explores ethical issues of its use in medical research. A ten-digit-PIN is maintained by the National Tax Board for all individuals that have resided in Sweden since 1947. Until January 2008, an estimated 75,638 individuals have changed PIN. The most common reasons for change of PIN are incorrect recording of date of birth or sex among immigrants or newborns. Although uncommon, change of sex always leads to change of PIN since the PIN is sex-specific. The most common reasons for re-use of PIN (n = 15,887), is when immigrants are assigned a PIN that has previously been assigned to someone else. This is sometimes necessary since there is a shortage of certain PIN combinations referring to dates of birth in the 1950s and 1960s. Several ethical issues can be raised pro and con the use of PIN in medical research. The Swedish PIN is a useful tool for linkages between medical registers and allows for virtually 100{\%} coverage of the Swedish health care system. We suggest that matching of registers through PIN and matching of national health registers without the explicit approval of the individual patient is to the benefit for both the individual patient and for society.},

abstract = {Objective: Given the fluidity with which the term shared decision making (SDM) is used in teaching, assessment and research, we conducted a focused and systematic review of articles that specifically address SDM to determine the range of conceptual definitions. Methods: In April 2005, we ran a Pubmed (Medline) search to identify articles published through 31 December 2003 with the words shared decision making in the title or abstract. The search yielded 681 citations, 342 of which were about SDM in the context of physician-patient encounters and published in English. We read and reviewed the full text of all 342 articles, and got any non-redundant references to SDM, which yielded an additional 76 articles. Results: Of the 418 articles examined, 161 (38.5{\%}) had a conceptual definition of SDM. We identified 31 separate concepts used to explicate SDM, but only "patient values/preferences" (67.1{\%}) and "options" (50.9{\%}) appeared in more than half the 161 definitions. Relatively few articles explicitly recognized and integrated previous work. Conclusion: Our review reveals that there is no shared definition of SDM. We propose a definition that integrates the extant literature base and outlines essential elements that must be present for patients and providers to engage in the process of SDM. Practice implications: The integrative definition of SDM is intended to provide a useful foundation for describing and operationalizing SDM in further research. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {In 2 Monte Carlo studies of fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis for correlations, A. P. Field (2001) ostensibly evaluated Hedges-Olkin-Vevea Fisher-z and Schmidt-Hunter Pearson-r estimators and tests in 120 conditions. Some authors have cited those results as evidence not to meta-analyze Fisher-z correlations, especially with heterogeneous correlation parameters. The present attempt to replicate Field's simulations included comparisons with analytic values as well as results for efficiency and confidence-interval coverage. Field's results under homogeneity were mostly replicable, but those under heterogeneity were not: The latter exhibited up to over .17 more bias than ours and, for tests of the mean correlation and homogeneity, respectively, nonnull rejection rates up to .60 lower and .65 higher. Changes to Field's observations and conclusions are recommended, and practical guidance is offered regarding simulation evidence and choices among methods. Most cautions about poor performance of Fisher-z methods are largely unfounded, especially with a more appropriate z-to-r transformation. The Appendix gives a computer program for obtaining Pearson-r moments from a normal Fisher-z distribution, which is used to demonstrate distortion due to direct z-to-r transformation of a mean Fisher-z correlation.},

abstract = {This study examined bias in the sample correlation coefficient, r, and its correction by unbiased estimators. Computer simulations revealed that the expected value of correlation coefficients in samples from a normal population is slightly less than the population correlation, {\&}{\#}961;, and that the bias is almost eliminated by an estimator suggested by R.A. Fisher and is more completely eliminated by a related estimator recommended by Olkin and Pratt. Transformation of initial scores to ranks and calculation of the Spearman rank correlation, rS, produces somewhat greater bias. Type I error probabilities of significance tests of zero correlation based on the Student t statistic and exact tests based on critical values of rS obtained from permutations remain fairly close to the significance level for normal and several non-normal distributions. However, significance tests of non-zero values of correlation based on the r to Z transformation are grossly distorted for distributions that violate bivariate normality. Also, significance tests of non-zero values of rS based on the r to Z transformation are distorted even for normal distributions.},

@article{Zou2007,
abstract = {Confidence intervals are widely accepted as a preferred way to present study results. They encompass significance tests and provide an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. However, comparisons of correlations still rely heavily on significance testing. The persistence of this practice is caused primarily by the lack of simple yet accurate procedures that can maintain coverage at the nominal level in a nonlopsided manner. The purpose of this article is to present a general approach to constructing approximate confidence intervals for differences between (a) 2 independent correlations, (b) 2 overlapping correlations, (c) 2 nonoverlapping correlations, and (d) 2 independent R2s. The distinctive feature of this approach is its acknowledgment of the asymmetry of sampling distributions for single correlations. This approach requires only the availability of confidence limits for the separate correlations and, for correlated correlations, a method for taking into account the dependency between correlations. These closed-form procedures are shown by simulation studies to provide very satisfactory results in small to moderate sample sizes. The proposed approach is illustrated with worked examples.

abstract = {Objective To estimate the global burden of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) as part of the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study and to explore how the burden of hip and knee OA compares with other conditions. Methods Systematic reviews were conducted to source age-specific and sex-specific epidemiological data for hip and knee OA prevalence, incidence and mortality risk. The prevalence and incidence of symptomatic, radiographic and self-reported hip or knee OA were included. Three levels of severity were defined to derive disability weights (DWs) and severity distribution (proportion with mild, moderate and severe OA). The prevalence by country and region was multiplied by the severity distribution and the appropriate disability weight to calculate years of life lived with disability (YLDs). As there are no deaths directly attributed to OA, YLDs equate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Results Globally, of the 291 conditions, hip and knee OA was ranked as the 11th highest contributor to global disability and 38th highest in DALYs. The global age-standardised prevalence of knee OA was 3.8{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval (UI) 3.6{\%} to 4.1{\%}) and hip OA was 0.85{\%} (95{\%} UI 0.74{\%} to 1.02{\%}), with no discernible change from 1990 to 2010. Prevalence was higher in females than males. YLDs for hip and knee OA increased from 10.5 million in 1990 (0.42{\%} of total DALYs) to 17.1 million in 2010 (0.69{\%} of total DALYs). Conclusions Hip and knee OA is one of the leading causes of global disability. Methodological issues within this study make it highly likely that the real burden of OA has been underestimated. With the aging and increasing obesity of the world's population, health professions need to prepare for a large increase in the demand for health services to treat hip and knee OA.},

The package is focussed on efficient and accurate evaluation of the Gauss hypergeometric function over the whole of the complex plane within the constraints of fixed-precision arithmetic. The hypergeometric series is convergent only within the unit circle, so analytic continuation must be used to define the function outside the unit circle. This short document outlines the numerical and conceptual methods used in the package; and justifies the package philosophy, which is to maintain transparent and verifiable links between the software and Abramowitz and Stegun (1965). Most of the package functionality is accessed via the single function hypergeo(), which dispatches to one of several methods depending on the value of its arguments. The package is demonstrated in the context of game theory.},

abstract = {To assess the quality of the fit in a multiple linear regression, the coefficient of determination or R2 is a very simple tool, yet the most used by practitioners. Indeed, it is reported in most statistical analyzes, and although it is not recommended as a final model selection tool, it provides an indication of the suitability of the chosen explanatory variables in predicting the response. In the classical setting, it is well known that the least-squares fit and coefficient of determination can be arbitrary and/or misleading in the presence of a single outlier. In many applied settings, the assumption of normality of the errors and the absence of outliers are difficult to establish. In these cases, robust procedures for estimation and inference in linear regression are available and provide a suitable alternative. In this paper we present a companion robust coefficient of determination that has several desirable properties not shared by others. It is robust to deviations from the specified regression model (like the presence of outliers), it is efficient if the errors are normally distributed, it does not make any assumption on the distribution of the explanatory variables (and therefore no assumption on the unconditional distribution of the responses). We also show that it is a consistent estimator of the population coefficient of determination. A simulation study and two real datasets support the appropriateness of this estimator, compared with classical (least-squares) and several previously proposed robust R2, even for small sample sizes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Purpose We compare pre-and post-operative health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and length of stay after total hip replacement (THR) in matched German and English patient cohorts to test for differences in admission thresholds, clinical effectiveness and resource utilisation between the healthcare systems. Methods German data (n = 271) were collected in a large orthopaedic hospital in Munich, Germany; English data (n = 26,254) were collected as part of the national patient-reported outcome measures programme. HRQoL was measured using the EuroQoL-5D instrument. Propen-sity score matching was used to construct two patient cohorts that are comparable in terms of preoperative patient characteristics. Results Before matching, patients in England showed lower preoperative EQ-5D scores (0.35 vs 0.52, p $\backslash$ 0.001) and experienced a larger improvement in HRQoL (0.43 vs 0.33, p $\backslash$ 0.001) than German patients. Patients in the German cohort were more likely to report no or only moderate problems with mobility and pain preoperatively than their English counterparts. After matching, improve-ments in HRQoL were comparable (0.32 vs 0.33, p = 0.638); post-operative scores were slightly higher in the German cohort (0.82 vs 0.85, p = 0.585). Length of stay was substantially lower in England than in Germany (4.5 vs 9.0 days, p $\backslash$ 0.001). Conclusions Our results highlight differences in preop-erative health status between countries, which may arise due to different admission thresholds and access to surgery. In terms of quality of life, THR surgery is equally effective in both countries when performed on similar patients, but hospital stay is shorter in England.},

abstract = {The proportion of explained variation in logistic regression can be expressed by the multiple R 2 originally developed for the general linear model (cf. MITTLBOCK and SCHEMPER (1996)). In this paper we present a detailed investigation of this measure in small samples and/or with many covariates and propose either of two adjustments, one being a direct analogue of R-adj(2) of the general linear model, and the other being based on shrinkage. Furthermore, we explore the use of bootstrap confidence intervals and give a table of the expected variability of estimates of explained variation for samples of varying sizes. We recommend to quantify gains of predictive precision due to prognostic factors by both relative and absolute measures. For binary outcomes the components of the relative measure, R-2, are suitable absolute measures of predictive precision. They are interpretable as average absolute residuals conditional on using prognostic factors and without such information. We motivate application of the presented measures by the statistical analysis of a study of physical characteristics of urine possibly related to the presence of calcium oxalate crystals.},

Although Pearson's r is biased, except for limited situations, and the minimum variance unbiased estimator has been proposed in the literature, researchers routinely employ the sample correlation coefficient in their practical applications, because of its simplicity and popularity. In order to support such practice, this study examines the mean squared errors of r and several prominent formulas. The results reveal specific situations in which the sample correlation coefficient performs better than the unbiased and nearly unbiased estimators, facilitating recommendation of r as an effect size index for the strength of linear association between two variables. In addition, related issues of estimating the squared simple correlation coefficient are also considered.},

abstract = {Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is regarded as one of the most successful surgical procedures of modern times yet continues to be associated with a small but significant complication rate. Many early failures may be associated with poor component positioning with, in particular, acetabular component orientation dependent on the subjective judgement of the surgeon. In this paper, we compare the manufacturers' instructions on acetabular cup orientation with the literature-based recommended safety zones and surgical technique, by transforming them onto a single, clinically-relevant framework in which the different reference systems, safety guidelines and current instrumentation surgical techniques can be evaluated. The observed limited consensus between results reflects ongoing uncertainty regarding the optimum acetabular component positioning. As malpositioning of the acetabular cup increases the risk of revision surgery, any ambiguity over the correct position can have a causal effect. Our analysis highlights the need for a surgical reference system which can be used to describe the position of the acetabular cup intra-operatively.},

In this paper we introduce a reproducible technique using the transverse acetabular ligament to determine the anteversion of the acetabular component. We have found that this ligament can be identified in virtually every hip undergoing primary surgery. We describe an intra-operative grading system for the appearance of the ligament. This technique has been used in 1000 consecutive cases. During a minimum follow-up of eight months the dislocation rate was 0.6{\%}. This confirms our hypothesis that the transverse acetabular ligament can be used to determine the position of the acetabular component. The method has been used in both conventional and minimally-invasive approaches.},

@article{Epstein2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that the transverse acetabular ligament (TAL) can be used to orient the acetabular component during total hip arthroplasty and that it can be identified in nearly all patients.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We attempted to determine how often the TAL could be identified during primary THA and its accuracy as a guide for acetabular component positioning.

METHODS: In a prospective series of 63 patients (64 hips) undergoing primary THA, two surgeons attempted to identify the TAL and, if it was found, to use it for acetabular component orientation. Patients in whom the TAL was identified served as the study group and the ligament was used for cup orientation in those patients; the remaining patients in whom the ligament could not be identified served as a control group and had free-hand cup positioning. Anteversion was determined by radiographic measurement from true lateral views.

RESULTS: The TAL was identified in only 30 hips (47{\%}) and was more likely to be found in patients who did not have inferior acetabular osteophytes. Acetabular position was not improved using this ligament for reference.

CONCLUSIONS: The TAL could not be routinely identified at surgery and when used for cup orientation it was no more accurate for cup positioning than free-hand technique.},
